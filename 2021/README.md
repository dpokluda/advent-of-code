# Advent of Code: 2021

This is a brand new thing for me. While I knew about this, I have never participated. This year I have decided to participate since I want to learn a new programming language. I will attempt to code all of the challenges in Python language. I will be using PyCharm IDE to get some familiarity with the environment as well.

My solutions will most probably not be the most efficient. As I am new to the language I will most probably be leveraging only the basic constructs and data-structures that the language offers. Over time I want to start using more advanced language capabilities.
